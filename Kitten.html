				<h3>Feeding</h3>
				<ul><li>Buy a good brand of kitten food, Friskies is our reccomended brand, but there are many good ones out there</li>
					<li>Feed your new Kitty a mix of wet and dry food, and while treats are not necessary they are certainly appreciated!</li>
					<li>We reccommend only feeding your cat twice a day; morning and night</li></ul>
				<h3>Clean Up</h3>
				<ul><li>Buy good sized litter boxes with any litter of your choice, fill the box about one third of the way</li>
					<li>Clean the litter box out once a day, every other week empty out all the litter and give it a good scrub</li>
					<li>We reccomend keeping one litter box on every floor of the house</li></ul>
				<h3>Other</h3>
				<ul><li>Play with your kitten regularly, go to your local pet store and pick out some toys that you and your kitten will enjoy playing with!</li>
					<li>Regularly pet and spend time with your kitten, they need a little TLC just like you and me</li>
					<li>Want to do even more for your cat? Try finding them a companion!</li>
					<li>Note: remember that you are required to spay or neuter your new fuzzy companion</li></ul>
